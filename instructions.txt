Objective

    In this exercise, we'll return to the programming fundamentals of logic and algorithmic thinking. This exercise involves designing the logic behind an inventory management system.

    For the sake of an encapsulated learning activity, we'll treat this as an inventory system for a simple game (like an RPG), although the principles can be applied to many different projects.

Requirements

    Use an HTML skeleton which runs a single JavaScript file
    
    Create an object representing the player character and give it the following properties
        Inventory
        Money quantity
        A method for displaying its own inventory

    Create a separate store inventory (an array), filled with items

    Each item should be an object with name, cost, and id properties

    Add separate functions for the following:
        Display store items
        Buy item from store
        Sell item back to store

    Note that buying and selling involves moving items between inventories, and changing money balances

    Every time an item is bought or sold, renumber each item in each inventory so that the items begin at #1 and increment from there. This is to solve the numbering problem that eventually arises when buying and selling arbitrary items.
